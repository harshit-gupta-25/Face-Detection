# Face-Detection
Face detection is a computer vision technology that helps to locate/visualize human faces in digital images. This technique is a specific use case of object detection technology that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings or cars) in digital images and videos. With the advent of technology, face detection has gained a lot of importance especially in fields like photography, security, and marketing.

# Application
• Facial recognition: Face detection is used in biometrics, often as a part of (or together with) a facial recognition system. It is also used in video surveillance, human computer interface and image database management.

• Photography: Some recent digital cameras use face detection for autofocus.[6] Face detection is also useful for selecting regions of interest in photo slideshows that use a pan-and-scale Ken Burns effect. Modern appliances also use smile detection to take a photograph at an appropriate time.

• Marketing: Face detection is gaining the interest of marketers. A webcam can be integrated into a television and detect any face that walks by. The system then calculates the race, gender, and agerange of the face. Once the information is collected, a series of advertisements can be played that is specific toward the detected race/gender/age.

• Emotional Inference: Face detection can be used as part of a software implementation of emotional inference. Emotional inference can be used to help people with autism under stand the feelings of people around them.

• Lip Reading: Face detection is essential for the process of language inference from visual cues. Automated lip reading has applications to help computers determine who is speaking which is needed when security is important.
